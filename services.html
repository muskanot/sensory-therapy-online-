    <h1>Our Occupational Therapy Services</h1>

    <h2>Pediatric Occupational Therapy</h2>
    <p>
      Pediatric Occupational Therapy focuses on improving a child’s ability to
      perform daily activities independently. Our online OT sessions help
      children build motor, sensory, cognitive and social skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Sensory Integration Therapy</h2>
    <p>
      Sensory Integration Therapy helps children who are over-sensitive or
      under-responsive to sensory input. Through structured sensory activities,
      children learn to regulate emotions, improve attention and reduce sensory
      overload.
    </p>

    <h2>Fine Motor Skill Development</h2>
    <p>
      Fine motor therapy focuses on hand strength, finger coordination and
      precision skills required for writing, buttoning, cutting and daily
      activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Handwriting Improvement Therapy</h2>
    <p>
      Our handwriting programs address letter formation, spacing, grip and
      writing speed using evidence-based OT techniques suitable for school-aged
      children.
    </p>

    <h2>Autism & ADHD Occupational Therapy</h2>
    <p>
      Specialized OT support for children with Autism and ADHD to improve
      attention, behavior regulation, sensory processing and functional
      independence.
    </p>

    <h2>Developmental Delay Therapy</h2>
    <p>
      Therapy designed to support children with delayed milestones in motor,
      sensory, cognitive and self-care skills using individualized treatment
      plans.
