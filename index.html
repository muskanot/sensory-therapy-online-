    <h2>What is Online Occupational Therapy?</h2>
    <p>
      Online Occupational Therapy is a structured and evidence-based therapy
      approach that helps children develop skills required for daily living,
      school participation and social interaction. Through guided virtual
      sessions, children receive personalized therapy programs while parents
      learn strategies to support their child at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Online OT is highly effective for pediatric conditions such as sensory
      processing difficulties, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, handwriting
      difficulties, fine motor delays and developmental delays. It allows
      therapy to continue in a familiar home environment, increasing comfort,
      consistency and carry-over of skills.
