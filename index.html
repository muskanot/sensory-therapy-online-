    <h2>What is Online Occupational Therapy?</h2>

    <p>
      Online Occupational Therapy is a structured therapeutic approach where
      a certified occupational therapist works with children and parents
      through secure online sessions. These sessions focus on improving
      a child’s ability to perform daily activities such as self-care,
      play, school tasks and social participation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Online OT is especially beneficial for children who experience
      sensory processing difficulties, fine motor delays, handwriting problems,
      attention difficulties, developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder
      or ADHD. Parents are actively involved in sessions, making therapy
      practical and effective at home.
